### User Flow Diagram

1. **Minting an INFT**
    - User signs a transaction
    - Smart contract mints INFT with metadata stored on Walrus
    - Metadata encrypted with Seal and access policies attached
2. **Viewing/Interacting**
    - Frontend dApp requests decryption key via Seal SDK
    - Seal backend verifies onchain policy and identity
    - Data decrypted on client-side
3. **Evolution**
    - User performs action (interaction, game, quest, etc.)
    - Updates stored encrypted state on Walrus
    - Smart contract updates NFT evolution metadata
4. **Gated Access/Unlock**
    - Creator attaches content to NFT with specific access conditions
    - Seal enforces policies (e.g., time-lock or allowlist)
    - Data decrypted only if access conditions are met
